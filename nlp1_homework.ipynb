Again, welcome!   \\n\\nHello!\\n\\nThanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.\\n\\nPick an image name.\\nWhen uploading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.\\n\\nSource the image.\\nOn the image description page, explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it\\'s from the web, give a URL.  If it\\'s a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.\\n\\nProvide copyright and license information.\\nThis part is a little bit trickier, but it\\'s very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.\\nIf it\\'s a photograph you took, or an image you created (modifying an image that already exists doesn\\'t count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{PD}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you\\'re using {{PD}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.\\nIf you didn\\'t create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might \"\"create\"\", but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as \"\"only for use by Wikipedia\"\", or \"\"for non-commercial use only\"\", or \"\"for educational use\"\".  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under fair use, but such a use should be justified on the image description page.\\n\\nDescribe the image.\\nTo another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn\\'t explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  \\n\\nSome links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: \\n\\nCopyrights, Copyright tags, Fair use, Image description page, Public domain, Images for deletion, Possibly unfree images, Copyright problems, Uploading images\\n\\nThanks again for your contributions.

Thanks!  \\n\\n Character bios \\n\\nIt is of my opinion that the short character bios preceeding the main characters\\' character descriptions are more than trivial information than what we really need to have in the article. Also, it\\'s not usually standard to give this type of information in characters sections on Wikipedia (I\\'ve seen at least), so I am going to go ahead and delete them.  (|talk) \\n\\nI have just added the Zuka Club to the \\'supporting characters\\' section; I thought they were at least as deserving of being mentioned as Nekozawa and Renge. I\\'m not so good with adding pictures - especially when I have none - or Japanese kanji. Is there anyone who can add these?  \\n\\nWell, I added the clubs section and a pic for each club, and I\\'ll get to the kanji for Zuka next.  (|talk) \\n\\n Cool. Nice choice of pictures.  \\n\\nI\\'ve added a brief piece on Kotoko Fujioka to the \\'supporting characters\\' section. Do you guys think it\\'s too much ...? And if not, could someone add the kanji and a picture?\\n\\nI added her picture, but I don\\'t know where to find the kanji for Kotoko.  (|talk) \\n\\nThey should be visible in the fansub of episode 19; there\\'s a scene of Ranka and Kotoko (Haruhi inside) when Ranka is having a flashback. I can\\'t read kanji myself, but the translation for the caption text said that\\'s what it says.\\n\\n Japanese Title \\nWhile glancing through the edit history, I found it interesting that a revert had been done with a comment that the previous user should learn to read katakana before making edits on the Japanese part of the pages.  Not being the user in question who made the first change that got reverted, I can only speculate on how much they actually knew, but the change made (and then reverted) wasn\\'t involved with katakana at all, as it was regarding the 部 in 桜蘭高校ホスト部, which is kanji.\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not all that fluent in the language, but I\\'ve seen no record of 部 being *directly* romanized into kurabu.  I have heard the characters use both hosuto-bu (ホスト部) and hosuto kurabu (ホストクラブ) at different times fairly interchangably, but the title of the anime itself uses the kanji.  Is there a translation for the kanji that directly romanizes into kurabu that I\\'m not aware of?  \\n\\nI\\'ve since figured out that the reason for this difference is due to the furigana used in both the anime and manga\\'s titles, hence the confusion - the loanword kurabu isn\\'t normally a given reading for the kanji.  However, in the two episodes of the anime where ホスト部 is directly referenced in the episode title, Haruhi uses bu instead of kurabu when reading it aloud, so there is still a difference there.  What would be the suggested method to approach this, given the vocal reading of it in the anime versus the usage of kurabu in the romanization of 部 in all Ouran-related pages, including the Episode title list?  \\n\\nI\\'ll be glad to clear this up for you. If you look at the image of the title of the anime given here, we see that above the kanji and to the left are a series of katakana characters. The last 3 of which spell out ku-ra-bu, hence why I stated the anon user learn to read katakana before editing the title again.  (|talk) \\n\\nYes, the furigana, as I noted later.  The anon user seemed either familiar with kanji itself though or used one of the translations that was based on only the kanji - without the furigana as a guide, \\'bu\\' would be the'\n",

This entire paragraph is just a series of claims made by ICMEC, not even a claim made by or supported by a neutral third party, so it should be worded to reflect that. We have more weasel in \"\"ICMEC has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child pornography\"\". We have sources given for this. The first is invalid, being a press release from ICMEC. the second, Rhona Schuz (2014). The Hague Child Abduction Convention: A Critical Analysis. A&C; Black. pp. 82–83, makes no mention of at all of child pornography, but talks about a conference on child custody problems in which the ICMEC took part, and which, according to the source resulted in \"\"little to solve the problems\"\". The third source is a strategic plan by the Hague Conference on Private International Law which again does not mention child pornography once. \\nThe last source talks about ICMEC being involved in training law enforcement officers in Thailand about child exploitation issues. This is not \"\"working with legislatures to adopt new laws\"\".

Linguists are said to be concerned \"\"normally\"\" with the former, implying that there is something abnormal about the latter. The notion that we are all culpable when helping people decide how to communicate, when seeking such help, and when making such decisions ourselves, is not only perverse and deplorable, but also patently wrong. We begin our lives incapable of speech. Is it wrong to acquire the ability? Is it right to call instruction in the application of the rules of grammar an invalid activity? Banning prescriptive grammar from the general article on grammar and suggesting that it is illegitimate are serious mistakes, motivated, I suspect, by timidity, laziness, irresponsibility, and ignorance. Only a stubborn, intentional, dedicated ignorance can maintain that proficiency in English composition must not be taught, nor properly called \"\"grammar\"\".  \"'\n",

Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.\\n\\nYou are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.\\n\\nYou need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying. \\n\\nIf you erase my writings again I will report you as a vandal. Really, do NOT do it again.\\n\\nMorgan Wright\"\n",

      " '\"\\n\\n More Answers \\n\\n \\nPATTY SAID\\n\\n<<  It clearly shows in the history that others furthered the breed by taking them to America and England. Thus the same with the Shiloh Shepherd. Some facts: While the ISSR was founded in 1991 as the first Shiloh registry, it was only 6 short years later that the first non ISSR registry and club was formed. Thus the ISSR was only the sole Shiloh Registry for 6 years while there have been non ISSR registries for 8.  >>\\n\\nTINA\\'S  REPLY\\n\\nROTF ... Talk about \"\"smoke & mirrors\"\" ... WOW!!  Now let\\'s look at some *varifiable* FACTS!\\n\\n1. The ISSR was formed to CONTINUE the data collection that I started in 1974!!  When it was set up I had documented data on MY breeding stock going all the way back to the 60\\'s ... all of this was incorporated into the ISSR database!!  Therefor ... the information that we have goes back for OVER 40 YEARS .... not \"\"6\"\" as you have stated!\\n\\n2. The ISSDC/r did not start till 1998, and was CLOSED DOWN in 2001!!  Most of those breeders scattered at that point, some returning to the ISSR (via the amnesty) while others went back to breeding AKC GSD\\'s ... etc. ONLY the NSBR started another \\'registry\\' that most of the former ISSDC/r  breeders did not agree with because her \"\"rules\"\" were so lax!\\n\\n This is a copy of the legitimate document sent to Mr. Cavanaugh, president of the UKC!\\n\\nPlease take a moment to review a FEW \"\"highlights\"\" from the http://www.shilohshepherds.com/letterToUKC.htm\\n\\nIs that correct??  Does this mean that all GSD/mixes may now enter your \"\"new breed\"\" UKC Shiloh Shepherd genepool? \\nColleen Gott states on her website that \\n\\n<<**Paragon\\'s outcross program**  The Shiloh Shepherd is a breed that was created by intense line breeding and inbreeding of AKC German Shepherds many years ago.  In fact, at one time, all of the dogs in our Shiloh Shepherd pedigrees were AKC registered German Shepherds, with the exception of the first outcross used years ago, Secret Samson Woo. After using Secret Samson Woo, who was not a purebred German Shepherd, Rare Breed recognition was applied for and granted.  The kennel name \"\"Shiloh\"\", at which these breedings took place, was the name given to the new Rare Breed that was created - the Shiloh Shepherd.  Now, once more, has come the time for an introduction of new blood as many years of linebreeding have taken place again.  In an effort to overcome some of the intense line breeding and over usage of the same dogs up so close in our pedigrees, Paragon Shepherds is introducing into our breeding program, dogs that contain the \"\"Old\"\" lines from the very early days of the Shiloh Shepherd breed, that made the breed what it is. These dogs, AKC German Shepherds, with the Old Original lines, also contain a splash of new blood from German-German Shepherd lines, American-German Shepherd lines and some Czech lines.  >> (http://www.paragonshilohs.com)\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nHow can you consider this hodgepodge as a legitimate breed definition?\\n\\n<> \\n\\nWhat does German Shepherd “family” mean? Any GSD/mix?\\n\\nThe fact that you would even consider recognizing this motley mix as a separate breed is an insult not only to the definition of Breed but also to every owner of a purebred dog.\\n\\n3. Furthermore, let\\'s take a good look at the word *BREED* ... I don\\'t think that *anyone* will dispute that every credible organization does NOT consider a dog to be \"\"purebred\"\" unless it has at least 3 generations of PURE lineage!!\\n\\nYet these \"\"registries\"\" constantly encourage \"\"outcrossing\"\" (nice word for MIXING IN ANYTHING) in order to produce more pups .... please take a look at THIS quote from the above mentioned letter!\\n\\n<< <>\\n\\nhttp://www.shilohregistry.com/rules.html \\n\\nEven the hybrid breeders are not pleased with this development because the serious ones take great care in properly screening their prospective new owners and properly socializing all of the pups they produce!

( talk ) they may well be , but they are not sourced that way . i don\\'t think we can expect the words \" \" new anti-semitism \" \" to appear in every single report we reference . we\\'ve defined it , and we\\'ve linked to many sources who are defining it . the definition is : it is a form of judenhass that emanates from the left . it is characterized by the demonization of the world\\'s only jewish state and of jews as an ethnicity and a religion . israel\\'s right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied . the jewish people\\'s right of self-determination is denied . double standards are applied , whereby the actions of the jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her . jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the jewish state . symbols and images associated with classic anti-semitism are used : for example , blood libels are resurrected , the jewish state and jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving jews or zionists or israelis plotting to take over the world , or being in control of other governments , or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others . arab and islamic anti-semitism are excused and ignored . straw-man attacks are made , whereby jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of israel is anti-semitism , and that is then used to condemn jewish groups as unreasonable , and to deny that there is any such thing as the \" \" new anti-semitism . \" \" all of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against jews and their synagogues and schools , particularly in europe . it is found in conjunction with anti-americanism ( because jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the american government ) , anti-zionism , and the anti-globalization movement . all the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components , so when we find them , we can offer them as examples , so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-semitism or attacks on jews . ( talk ) my worry is that livingstone has not been ( at least in the sources provided ) accused of anti-semitism , and that most of the discussion of galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters . add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism ( not reporting others allegations ) , which is or ( and unwise in the case of galloway ) . the nus thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so i\\'d just want to tidy that up . livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-semitism ( got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it ) , as has galloway , and without question his supporters . the section talks about it in relation to that election . by all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit , and we can talk later if there are any disagreements .

( so that outside party is one who saved markets from collapse - not geitner , bernanke , paulson ) this lack of market knowledge by all three , paulson , geitner , and bernanke , is important to understand in understanding depth of market understanding in current proposals to allow us treasury to dictate systemic risk decision , when no one at the us treasury , other than saying those words , has shown any knowledge of markets to be able to determine what that is . / s / harvey keitel , markit bon vivant jr 69.121 . 221.97 iq & markets in the iq discussion in the article it is touted that the bernanke has a higher iq and that qualified him for his job . also it has been mentioned that he is an expert in depression era events . neither worked to have bernanke act appropriately in this global crisis which he / bernanke caused via fighting the spike in oil and gold prices and his efforts directly caused this crisis . so that with bernanke\\'s higher iq did not have him perceive what he was doing would cause a near global market meltdown and his studies of the depression era did not clue him in not to cause nearly a depression . / s too true ioq ix 69.121 . 221.97 demonizing wall street for us government caused crisis in the bubble , all agree was caused by greenspan , and in the huge push to give mortgages to those non qualified which all agree was caused by fannie mae , etc and by congress , this directly lead to the subprime debacle and beginning of the global crisis - none of which was caused by wall street . then in the fight by bernanke to stop the projected inflation caused by oil & gold spikes , his actions massively slammed the overall economy which was perking along just fine even with the subprime debaclev which was a smaller part of the usa $ 15 trillion economy . next , massive jaw boning of the huge crisis was done by paulson to get funds and that caused the coup de grace , the huge retrenchment of all spending by consumers ... all these events were not caused by wall street then paulson , bernanke and later hugely obama and congress , again and again bad mouthed again and again wall street claiming that this whole series of events was caused by wall street when it was mainly caused by the us governement and aided by consumer spending retrenchment but congres and the pundits caused the us population to believe the lie it was wall street\\'s fault due to gambling . all distortion 100 % . destruction of capital formation and wall street one of the key features of bernanke\\'s job in oversight for the usa economy is in also protecting capital formation ... and the engine of economic growth in the usa for 300 years has been the usa efficient capital distribution to new ventures , old ventures , etc and the recent sequence of bad mouthing by all concerned of wall street publicly now and including esp the talking heads on cnn and esp cnbc has severely damaged that core of the reason for usa dominance and leadership for those 300 years . added to that huge destruction is the special refusal by all of the us government to identify and prosecute the huge fraudulent short selling of all major wall street firms and major usa banks which was fraudulent esp as done in a intentional and ever increasing crecend'\n",
